# 4-Bit-Quantized-CUDA-Kernel

## Overview

NVIDIA's CUDA ecosystem provides robust support for a wide range of data types and operations, yet it stops short of offering native support for 4-bit quantized integers. This repository introduces a novel approach to bridging this gap, presenting a fully functional, signed 4-bit integer CUDA kernel designed for high-performance computing applications where memory efficiency is crucial.

## Technical Details

- **Quantization and Storage**: Utilizing a custom quantization algorithm, integers are scaled to a 4-bit signed format. Pairs of quantized integers are then stored in an 8-bit container, maintaining high memory efficiency.
- **Lazy Evaluation**: To combat the inherent inefficiency of operating on quantized data, the kernel employs lazy evaluation strategies. This approach defers the expansion and computation of quantized values until absolutely necessary, reducing memory usage and computational overhead.
- **Memory Management**: The implementation carefully manages memory to ensure that only one "full-size" 8-bit matrix is in memory at any time. This strategy optimizes both the memory footprint and computational efficiency of operations on the GPU.

## The Challenge

The CUDA programming model and the underlying C++ language do not natively support 4-bit integers. This limitation poses a significant challenge for applications that can benefit from the memory efficiency of quantized data types, such as deep learning models and high-precision arithmetic operations.

To overcome this limitation, we developed a method for representing signed 4-bit integers (int4) within the CUDA environment. Our approach involves quantizing integers to a 4-bit representation and then pairing them to be stored within a single 8-bit integer. This technique effectively doubles the memory efficiency by allowing the storage of two quantized integers in the space traditionally occupied by a single 8-bit integer.

### Memory Efficiency and Lazy Evaluation

A noteworthy aspect of our implementation is the consideration for memory usage and computational efficiency. While pairing 4-bit integers within an 8-bit container improves memory density, we further optimize resource utilization through lazy evaluation of arithmetic operations. This method ensures that data is only expanded to a full 8-bit representation when necessary for computation, minimizing memory footprint and data movement. As a result, operations are executed more swiftly, and the overhead of moving data between host and device memory is significantly reduced, as data transfer occurs once and only as required.
